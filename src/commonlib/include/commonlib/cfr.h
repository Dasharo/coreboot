/*
 * PUBLIC API
 *
 * The CFR table information is for conveying available boot
 * option of the firmware to the loaded OS image or payload.
 * Primarily this is expected to be information that is user
 * visible.
 *
 * The boot options are grouped into forms, where each form hold
 * one ore more options.
 * Boot options that are not used in the current boot flow, but
 * are reachable under certain conditions should be marked as hidden.
 *
 * A boot option can be one of the following types:
 * - boolean
 * - number
 * - enum
 * - string
 *
 * Each boot option has an UI name and UI help text that is free to
 * choose. All strings are in ASCII.
 *
 * All of the information should be Position Independent Data.
 * That is it should be safe to relocated any of the information
 * without it's meaning/correctness changing.   For table that
 * can reasonably be used on multiple architectures the data
 * size should be fixed.  This should ease the transition between
 * 32 bit and 64 bit architectures etc.
 *
 * CFR records form a tree structure. The size of a record includes
 * the size of its own fields plus the size of all children records.
 * CFR tags can appear multiple times except for `LB_TAG_CFR` which
 * is used for the root record.
 *
 * The following structures have comments that describe the supported
 * children records. These comments cannot be replaced with code! The
 * structures are variable-length, so the offsets won't be valid most
 * of the time. Besides, the implementation uses `sizeof()` to obtain
 * the size of the "record header" (the fixed-length members); adding
 * the children structures as struct members will increase the length
 * returned by `sizeof()`, which complicates things for zero reason.

 * The optional flags describe the visibilty of the option and the
 * effect on the non-volatile variable.
 * CFR_OPTFLAG_READONLY:
 *   Prevents writes to the variable.
 * CFR_OPTFLAG_GRAYOUT:
 *   Implies READONLY. The option is visible, but cannot be modified
 *   because one of the dependencies are not given. However there's a
 *   possibility to enable the option by changing runtime configuration.
 *
 *   For example: Setting SATA mode, but SATA is globally disabled.
 * CFR_OPTFLAG_SUPPRESS:
 *   Runtime code sets this flag to indicate that the option has no effect
 *   and is never reachable, not even by changing runtime configuration.
 *   This option is never shown in the UI.
 * CFR_OPTFLAG_VOLATILE:
 *   Implies READONLY.
 *   The option is not backed by a non-volatile variable. This is useful
 *   to display the current state of a specific component, a dependency or
 *   a serial number. This information could be passed in a new coreboot
 *   table, but it not useful other than to be shown at this spot in the
 *   UI.
 * CFR_OPTFLAG_RUNTIME:
 *  The option is allowed to be changed by a post payload entity. On UEFI
 *  this sets the EFI_VARIABLE_RUNTIME_ACCESS attribute.
 *  It is out of scope of this specification how non runtime variables
 *  are protected after the payload has hand over control.
