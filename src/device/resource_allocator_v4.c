 * requirements of the downstream devices. They represent the available windows from which
 * resources can be allocated to the different devices under the domain.
 *
 * In order to identify the requirements of downstream devices, resource allocator walks in a
 * DFS fashion. It gathers the requirements from leaf devices and propagates those back up
 * to their upstream bridges until the requirements for all the downstream devices of the domain
 * are gathered. This is referred to as pass 1 of resource allocator.
 *
 * Once the requirements for all the devices under the domain are gathered, resource allocator
 * walks a second time to allocate resources to downstream devices as per the
 * requirements. It always picks the biggest resource request as per the type (i/o and mem) to
 * allocate space from its fixed window to the immediate downstream device of the domain. In
 * order to accomplish best fit for the resources, a list of ranges is maintained by each
 * resource type (i/o and mem). Domain does not differentiate between mem and prefmem. Since
 * they are allocated space from the same window, the resource allocator at the domain level
 * ensures that the biggest requirement is selected indepedent of the prefetch type. Once the
 * resource allocation for all immediate downstream devices is complete at the domain level,
 * resource allocator walks down the subtree for each downstream bridge to continue the
 * allocation process at the bridge level. Since bridges have separate windows for i/o, mem and
 * prefmem, best fit algorithm at bridge level looks for the biggest requirement considering
 * prefmem resources separately from non-prefmem resources. This continues until resource
 * allocation is performed for all downstream bridges in the domain sub-tree. This is referred
 * to as pass 2 of resource allocator.
 *
 * Some rules that are followed by the resource allocator:
 *  - Allocate resource locations for every device as long as the requirements can be satisfied.
 *  - If a resource cannot be allocated any address space, then that resource needs to be
 * properly updated to ensure that it does not incorrectly overlap some address space reserved
 * for a different purpose.
 *  - Don't overlap with resources in fixed locations.
 *  - Don't overlap and follow the rules of bridges -- downstream devices of bridges should use
