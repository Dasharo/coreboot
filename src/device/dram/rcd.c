/**
 *
 * Registering Clock Driver (RCD) is responsible for driving address and control
 * nets on RDIMM and LRDIMM applications. Its operation is configurable by a set
 * of Register Control Words (RCWs). There are two ways of accessing RCWs:
 * in-band on the memory channel as an MRS commands ("MR7") or through I2C.
 *
 * From JESD82-31: "For changes to the control word setting, (...) the
 * controller needs to wait tMRD after _the last control word access_, before
 * further access _to the DRAM_ can take place". MRS is passed to rank 0 of the
 * DRAM, but MR7 is reserved so it is ignored by DRAM. tMRD (8nCK) applies here,
 * unless longer delay is needed for RCWs which control the clock timing (see
 * JESD82-31 for list of such). This makes sense from DRAMs point of view,
 * however we are talking to the Registering Clock Driver (RCD), not DRAM. From
 * parts marked in the sentence above one may assume that only one delay at the
 * end is necessary and RCWs can be written back to back; however, in the same
 * document in table 141 tMRD is defined as "Number of clock cycles between two
 * control word accesses, MRS accesses, or any DRAM commands".
 *
 * I2C access to RCWs is required to support byte (8b), word (16b) and double
 * word (32b) write size. Bigger blocks are not required. Reads must always be
 * 32b, 32b-aligned blocks, even when reading just one RCW. RCD ignores the two
 * lowest bits so unaligned accesses would return shifted values. RCWs are
 * tightly packed in I2C space, so it is not possible to write just one 4b RCW
 * without writing its neighbor. This is especially important for F0RC06,
 * Command Space Control Word, as it it able to reset the state of RCD. For this
 * reason, the mentioned register has NOP command (all 1's). JESD82-31 does not
 * specify timeouts required for such multi-RCWs writes, or any other writes.
 * These are not MRS accesses, so it would be strange to apply those timeouts.
 * Perhaps only the registers that actually change the clock settings require
 * time to stabilize. On the other hand, I2C is relatively slow, so it is
 * possible that the write itself is long enough.
 *
 * RCD I2C address is 0xBx (or 0x58 + DIMM number, depending on convention), it
 * is located on the same bus as SPD. It uses a bus command encoding, see
 * section 3.3 in JESD82-31 for description of reading and writing register
 * values.
 *
 * This file includes only functions for access through I2C - it is generic,
 * while MRS commands are passed to memory controller registers in an
 * implementation specific way.
