 * 14.5 proc_setup_bars: Setup Memory BARs
 *
 * a) p9_mss_setup_bars.C (proc chip) -- Nimbus
 * b) p9c_mss_setup_bars.C (proc chip) -- Cumulus
 *    - Same HWP interface for both Nimbus and Cumulus, input target is
 *      TARGET_TYPE_PROC_CHIP; HWP is to figure out if target is a Nimbus (MCS)
 *      or Cumulus (MI) internally.
 *    - Prior to setting the memory bars on each processor chip, this procedure
 *      needs to set the centaur security protection bit
 *      - TCM_CHIP_PROTECTION_EN_DC is SCOM Addr 0x03030000
 *      - TCN_CHIP_PROTECTION_EN_DC is SCOM Addr 0x02030000
 *      - Both must be set to protect Nest and Mem domains
 *    - Based on system memory map
 *      - Each MCS has its mirroring and non mirrored BARs
 *      - Set the correct checkerboard configs. Note that chip flushes to
 *        checkerboard
 *      - need to disable memory bar on slave otherwise base flush values will
 *        ack all memory accesses
 * c) p9_setup_bars.C
 *    - Sets up Powerbus/MCD, L3 BARs on running core
 *      - Other cores are setup via winkle images
 *    - Setup dSMP and PCIe Bars
 *      - Setup PCIe outbound BARS (doing stores/loads from host core)
 *        - Addresses that PCIE responds to on powerbus (PCI init 1-7)
 *      - Informing PCIe of the memory map (inbound)
 *        - PCI Init 8-15
 *    - Set up Powerbus Epsilon settings
 *      - Code is still running out of L3 cache
 *      - Use this procedure to setup runtime epsilon values
 *      - Must be done before memory is viable
