 *
 * a) p9_mem_pll_initf.C (proc chip)
 *    - This step is a no-op on cumulus
 *    - This step is a no-op if memory is running in synchronous mode since the
 *      MCAs are using the nest PLL, HWP detect and exits
 *    - MCA PLL setup
 *      - Note that Hostboot doesn't support twiddling bits, Looks up which
 *        "bucket" (ring) to use from attributes set during mss_freq
 *      - Then request the SBE to scan ringId with setPulse
 *        - SBE needs to support 5 RS4 images
 *        - Data is stored as a ring image in the SBE that is frequency specific
 *        - 5 different frequencies (1866, 2133, 2400, 2667, EXP)
