	  Enabling this option will skip initial ECC scrubbing that is normally
	  done right after memory is written with an initial pattern. This is
	  not the same as clearing memory after init, ECC memory always has to
	  be filled with any value in order to make ECC correct.
	  Selecting this option almost halves the time needed for memory
	  initialization (istep 14.1).
