/*
 * ECC Scrubbing - theory
 *
 * RAM cannot hold the data indefinitely. It uses capacitors to hold the bits,
 * which are constantly being drawn by leaks. To counteract this, memory has to
 * be periodically refreshed, which recharges the capacitors. However, sometimes
 * this happens too late, when state of capacitor has already changed (either
 * electric charge was depleted, or capacitor gained additional potential from
 * outside - rowhammer, radiation) up to the point where it passes the threshold
 * and 0 becomes 1 or vice versa. Refresh command in that case would only make
 * "borderline 1" into "strong 1", so it won't be able to fix the problem. This
 * is where ECC comes in.
 *
 * ECC is limited in number of changed bits it can fix and detect. Because of
 * that it is important that ECC is checked and possible errors are corrected
 * before too many bits have flipped, and corrected values are written back to
 * RAM. This is done by hardware, without software's interaction, but it can be
 * informed that ECC error has happened (machine check exception).
 *
 * ECC is checked every time data in RAM is accessed. To check every part of RAM
 * even when CPU doesn't need to read it, memory controller does the accesses in
 * the background. This is called ECC scrubbing.
 *
 * Note that it is enough for MC to just send read commands. When everything is
 * correct, data is still written back to DRAM because reading operation is
 * destructive - capacitors are discharged when read and have to be charged
 * again. This happens internally in DRAM, there is no need to send that data
 * through the memory bus when DRAM already has it. If there was an error, MC
 * automatically sends corrected data to be written.
 *
 * ECC scrubbing happens between RAM and MC. CPU doesn't participate in this
 * process, but it may be slowed down on memory intensive operations because
 * some of the bandwidth is used for scrubbing.
 *
 * TL;DR: ECC scrub is read operation with discarded results.

 *    - Nimbus uses the mcbist engine
 *      - Still supports superfast read/init/scrub
 *    - Cumulus/Centaur uses the scrub engine
 *    - Modes:
 *      - Minimal: Write-only with 0's
 *      - Standard: Write of 0's followed by a Read
 *      - Medium: Write-followed by Read, 4 patterns, last of 0's
 *      - Max: Write-followed by Read, 9 patterns, last of 0's
 *    - Run on the host
