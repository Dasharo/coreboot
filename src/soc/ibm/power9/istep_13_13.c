/*
 * Set up the MC port <-> DIMM address translation registers.
 *
 * These are not documented in specs, everything described here comes from the
 * code (and comments). Depending on how you count them, there are 2 or 3 base
 * configurations, and the rest is a modification of one of the bases or its
 * derived forms. Each level usually adds one row bit, but sometimes it removes
 * it or modifies rank bits. In most cases when it happens, the rest of bits
 * must be shifted.
 *
 * There are two pairs of identical settings for each master/slave rank
 * configurations: 4Gb x4 is always the same as 8Gb x8, and 8Gb x4 is the same
 * as 16Gb x8.
 *
 * Base configurations are:
 * - 1 rank, non-3DS 4Gb x4 and second DIMM is also 1R (not necessarily 4Gb x4)
 *   - special case when the other DIMM is not an 1R device (because of allowed
 *     DIMM mixing this can only mean tha the other slot is not populated)
 * - 2 rank, non-3DS 4Gb x4
 *
 * The special case uses different column, bank and bank group addressing, the
 * other two cases use identical mapping. This is due to the fact that for one
 * 1R DIMM there is no port address bit with index 7, which is used as C9 in
 * other cases. Hostboot divides those cases as listed above, but it might make
 * more sense to separate special case and use uniform logic for the rest.
 * However, for two 1R DIMMs port address 29 is always assigned to D-bit (more
 * about it later), because bit map fields for rows use only 3 bit for encoding,
 * meaning that only port bits 0-7 can be mapped to row bits 15-17.
 *
 * According to code, port addresses 0-7 and 22-32 can be configured in the
 * register - 19 possibilities total, encoded, so bit field in register is 5
 * bits long, except for row bitmaps, which are only 3 bits long (addresses 0-7
 * only). Column, bank and bank group addressing is always the same (DDR4 always
 * has 10 column, 2 bank, 2 bank group bits), difference is in row bit mapping
 * (we may or may not have bits 15, 16 and 17, those are indexed from 0 so we
 * can have 15-18 row bits in total) and ranks mapping (up to 2 bits for master
 * ranks, up to 3 bits for slave ranks in 3DS devices).
 *
 * TODO: what about 16Gb bank groups? Those should use just 1 bit, but the code
 * doesn't change it.
 *
 * Apart from already mentioned bits there is also D-bit (D is short for DIMM).
 * It is used to tell the controller which DIMM has to be accessed. To avoid
 * holes in the memory map, larger DIMM must be mapped to lower addresses. For
 * example, when we have 4GB and 8GB DIMMs:
 *
 * 0       4       8      12      16 ...      memory space, in GB
 * |   DIMM X      |DIMM Y | hole  | ...             <- this is good
 * |DIMM Y | hole  |   DIMM X      | ...             <- this is bad
 *
 * Whether DIMM X is in DIMM0 or DIMM1 slot doesn't matter. The example is
 * simplified - the addresses do not translate directly to CPU address space.
 * There are multiple MCAs in the system, they are grouped together later in
 * 14.5, based on the mappings calculated in 7.4.
 *
 * There are two pieces to configure for D-bit:
 * - D_BIT_MAP - which address bit is used to decide which DIMM is used (this
 *   corresponds to 8GB in the example above), this is common to both DIMMs,
 * - SLOTn_D_VALUE - what value should the D-bit have to access DIMMn, each DIMM
 *   has its own SLOTn_D_VALUE, when one DIMM has this bit set, the other one
 *   must have it cleared; in the (good) example above DIMM Y should have this
 *   bit set. When both DIMMs have the same size then only one D_VALUE must be
 *   set, but it doesn't matter which one.
 *
 * TODO: what if only one DIMM is present? Do we have to set these to something
 * sane (0 and 0 should work) or is it enough that VALID bit is clear for the
 * other DIMM?
 *
 * If bits are assigned in a proper order, we can use a constant table with
 * mappings and assign values from that table to registers describing address
 * bits in a sparse manner, depending on a number of rank and row bits used by
 * a given DIMM. The order is based on the cost of changing individual bits on
 * the DIMM side (considering data locality):
 * 1. Bank group, bank and column bits are sent with every read/write command.
 *    It takes RL = AL + CL + PL after the read command until first DQ bits
 *    appear on the bus. In practice we usually don't care about write delays,
 *    when data is sent to the controller the CPU can already execute further
 *    code, it doesn't have to wait until it is actually written to DRAM. This
 *    is a cheap change.
 *    TODO: this is for DRAM, any additional delay caused by RCD, PHY or MC?
 * 2. Ranks (both master and slave) are selected by CS (and Chip ID for slave
 *    ranks) bits, they are also sent with each command. Depending on MR4
 *    settings, we may need to wait for additional tCAL (CS to Command Address
 *    Latency), DRAM needs some time to "wake up" before it can parse commands.
 *    If tCAL is not used (default in Hostboot), the cost is the same as for BG,
 *    BA, column bits. It doesn't matter whether master or slave ranks are
 *    assigned first, but Hostboot starts with slave ranks - it has 5 bits per
 *    bit map, so it can encode higher numbers.
 * 3. Row bits - these are expensive. Row must be activated before its column
 *    are accessed. Each bank can have one activated row at a time. If there was
 *    an open row (different than the one we want to access), it must be
 *    precharged (it takes tRP before next activation command can be issued),
 *    and then the new row can be activated (after which we have to wait for
 *    tRCD before sending the read/write command). A row cannot be opened
 *    indefinitely, there is both a minimal and maximal period between ACT and
 *    PRE commands (tRAS), and minimums for read to precharge (tRTP), ACT to ACT
 *    for different banks (tRRD, with differentiation between the same and
 *    different bank groups) and Four Activate Window (tFAW). When row changes
 *    don't happen too often, we usually have to wait for tRCD and sometimes
 *    also tRP, on top of the previous delays.
 * 4. D bit. Two DIMMs on a channel share all of its lines except CLK, CS, ODT
 *    and CKE bits. Because we don't have to change CS for a given DIMM, the
 *    cost is the same as 1 (assuming hardware holds CS between commands).
 *    However, this bit has to be assigned lastly (i.e. it has to be the most
 *    significant port address bit) to not introduce holes in the memory space
 *    for two differently sized DIMMs.
 *     * TODO: can we safely map it closer to LSB (at least before row bits)
 *       when we have two DIMMs with the same size?
 *
 * TODO: what about bad DQ bits? Do they impact this in any way? Probably not,
 * unless a whole DIMM is disabled.
 *
