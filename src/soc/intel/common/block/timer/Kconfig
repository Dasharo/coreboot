	  Setting this makes the Legacy 8254 Timer available by disabling
	  clock gating. This needs to be enabled in order to boot a legacy
	  BIOS or OS not supporting other timers like PM timer or TSC.

	  While SeaBIOS does not require this timer anymore, it is needed
	  when OpRoms are being used.

	  Disable this setting to save power, when the timer is not needed.
