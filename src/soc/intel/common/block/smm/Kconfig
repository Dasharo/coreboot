config SOC_INTEL_COMMON_BLOCK_SMM
	bool
	help
	  Intel Processor common SMM support

config SOC_INTEL_COMMON_BLOCK_SMM_IO_TRAP
	bool
	help
	  Intel Processor trap flag if it is supported

config SOC_INTEL_COMMON_BLOCK_SMM_LOCK_GPIO_PADS
	bool
	help
	  Enable locking of security-sensitive SoC and mainboard GPIOs.
	  An SoC may provide a list of gpios to lock, and the mainboard
	  may also provide a list of gpios to lock.

config SOC_INTEL_COMMON_BLOCK_SMM_ESPI_DISABLE
	bool
	default n
	help
	  Disable eSPI SMI source to prevent the embedded controller
	  from asserting SMI while in firmware.

config SOC_INTEL_COMMON_BLOCK_SMM_TCO_ENABLE
	bool "Enable TCO SMI"
	default n
	help
	  Enable TCO SMI source to e.g. handle case instrusion.

config SOC_INTEL_COMMON_BLOCK_SMM_S5_DELAY_MS
	int
	default 100 if CHROMEOS
	default 0
	help
	  Time in milliseconds that SLP_SMI for S5 waits for before
	  enabling sleep. This is required to avoid any race between
	  SLP_SMI and PWRBTN SMI.

config HECI_DISABLE_USING_SMM
	bool
	depends on SOC_INTEL_COMMON_BLOCK_SMM
	default n
	help
	  HECI disable using SMM. Select this option to make HECI disable
	  using SMM mode, independent of dedicated UPD to perform HECI disable.

config PERIODIC_SMI_RATE_SELECTION_IN_GEN_PMCON_B
	bool
	depends on SOC_INTEL_COMMON_BLOCK_SMM
	default n
	help
	  Intel Core processors select the periodic SMI rate via GEN_PMCON_A.
	  On Intel Atom processors the register is different and they use
	  GEN_PMCON_B/GEN_PMCON2 with different address.

config SOC_INTEL_COMMON_BLOCK_SMM_NO_MSR_SPCL_CHIPSET_USAGE
	bool
	depends on SOC_INTEL_COMMON_BLOCK_SMM
	default n
	help
	  Intel Core processors write the MSR_SPCL_CHIPSET_USAGE to allow
	  writes to the BIOS region when EISS is enabled. Some processors
	  may not have this MSR. If so, select this option.
