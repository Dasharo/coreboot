	  Fast SPI controller on the platform supports additional
	  window for memory mapping BIOS region (region 1) on the SPI
	  flash beyond the standard limit of 16MiB. Depending upon the
	  size of the SPI flash part used by the mainboard, two decode
	  windows will be enabled:
	    1. Fixed decode window up to a maximum size of 16MiB under
	       4G boundary.
	    2. Extended decode window up to a maximum size provided by
	       the platform to map the rest of the BIOS region.
	  SoC selecting this config is expected to provide the base and
	  maximum size of the extended window in the host address space
	  using configs EXT_BIOS_WIN_BASE and EXT_BIOS_WIN_SIZE.

config EXT_BIOS_WIN_BASE
	hex
	help
	  If an additional window for mapping BIOS region greater than
	  16MiB is supported, then this config is used to provide the
	  base address reserved for the mapping. Since the mapping is
	  done at the top of the window, depending upon the size of the
	  BIOS region, the actual base address configured in the fast
	  SPI controller can be higher at runtime.

config EXT_BIOS_WIN_SIZE
	hex
	help
	  Maximum size of the extended window reserved for mapping BIOS
	  region greater than 16MiB. The actual mapped window might be
	  smaller depending upon the size of the BIOS region.

config EXT_BIOS_FILL_UP
	bool
	default n
	help
	  Extend BIOS region to the beginning of the flash for the
	  purposes of mapping.

	  Select this option if the Fast SPI controller is hidden from the OS.
	  If this switch is selected, an entry in the SSDT will be generated
	  for the controller to report the occupied resource which is not
	  discoverable at OS runtime.
