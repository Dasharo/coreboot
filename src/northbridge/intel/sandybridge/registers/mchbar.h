 * ### IOSAV memory controller interface poking state machine notes ###
 *
 * IOSAV brings batch processing to memory training algorithms.
 *
 * The hardware is capable of executing a sequence of DRAM commands,
 * which can be composed of up to four sub-sequences.
 *
 * A sub-sequence (from now on, subseq) consists of executing the same
 * DRAM command for a configurable number of times, with adjustable
 * delay between the commands, as well as an address auto-increment
 * value, which is added after a given number of command executions.
 *
 * There are four groups of registers in MCHBAR, one for each subseq.
 * When firing up IOSAV, one needs to specify the number of subseqs it
 * should use.
 *
 * The macros for these registers can take some integer parameters.
 * Valid values are:
 *   channel:   0..1 or 3 to broadcast to all channels.
 *   index:     0..3
 *   lane:      0..8
 *
 * These ranges are inclusive: both upper and lower bounds are valid.
 *
 *
 *
 * ### Register descriptions ###
 *
 * IOSAV_n_SP_CMD_ADDR_ch(channel, index)
 *   Configures the row/column, bank and rank addresses. When a subseq
 *   begins to execute, the address fields define the address of the
 *   first command in the subseq. The address is updated after each
 *   command as configured in the "IOSAV_n_ADDR_UPDATE" registers,
 *   and the updated address is then written back into this register.
 *
 *   Bitfields:
 *   [15..0]    Row / Column Address. Defines the ADDR pins when
 *              issuing a DRAM command.
 *
 *   [18..16]   The number of valid row bits is this value, plus 10.
 *                  Note: Value 1 is not implemented.
 *                        Value 7 is unsupported, and thus reserved.
 *
 *   [22..20]   Bank select.
 *   [25..24]   Rank select. It is later referred to as "ranksel".
 *
 * IOSAV_n_ADDR_UPDATE_ch(channel, index)
 *   How the address updates after executing a command in the subseq.
 *
 *   Bitfields:
 *   [0]        Increment row/column address by 1.
 *   [1]        Increment row/column address by 8.
 *   [2]        Increment bank select by 1.
 *   [4..3]     Increment rank select by 1, 2 or 3.
 *   [9..5]     Known as "addr_wrap", it limits the address increments.
 *              Address bits will wrap around the [addr_wrap..0] range.
 *
 *   [11..10]   LFSR update:
 *                  00: Do not use the LFSR function.
 *                  01: Undefined, treat as Reserved.
 *                  10: Apply LFSR on the [addr_wrap..0] bit range.
 *                  11: Apply LFSR on the [addr_wrap..3] bit range.
 *
 *   [15..12]   Update rate. The number of command runs between address updates. For example:
 *                  0: Update every command run.
 *                  1: Update every second command run. That is, half of the command rate.
 *                  N: Update after N command runs without updates.
 *
 *   [17..16]   LFSR behavior on the deselect cycles (when no subseq command is issued):
 *                  0: No change w.r.t. the last issued command.
 *                  1: LFSR XORs with address & command (excluding CS), but does not update.
 *                  2: LFSR XORs with address & command (excluding CS), and updates.
 *
 * IOSAV_n_SP_CMD_CTRL_ch(channel, index)
 *   Configures how the DRAM command lines will be driven in each
 *   command of the subseq.
 *
 *   Bitfields:
 *   [0]        !RAS signal (as driven electrically).
 *   [1]        !CAS signal (as driven electrically).
 *   [2]        !WE  signal (as driven electrically).
 *
 *   [4]        CKE, for DIMM 0 Rank 0.
 *   [5]        CKE, for DIMM 0 Rank 1.
 *   [6]        CKE, for DIMM 1 Rank 0.
 *   [7]        CKE, for DIMM 1 Rank 1.
 *   [11..8]    ODT, per DIMM & Rank (same encoding as CKE).
 *   [15..12]   Chip select, per DIMM and Rank. It works as follows:
 *
 *          entity CS_BLOCK is
 *              port (
 *                  MODE    : in  std_logic;                -- Mode select at [16]
 *                  RANKSEL : in  std_logic_vector(0 to 3); -- Decoded "ranksel" value
 *                  CS_CTL  : in  std_logic_vector(0 to 3); -- Chip select control at [15..12]
 *                  CS_Q    : out std_logic_vector(0 to 3)  -- CS signals
 *              );
 *          end entity CS_BLOCK;
 *
 *          architecture RTL of CS_BLOCK is
 *          begin
 *              if MODE = '1' then
 *                  CS_Q <= not RANKSEL and CS_CTL;
 *              else
 *                  CS_Q <= CS_CTL;
 *              end if;
 *          end architecture RTL;
 *
 *   [16]       Chip Select mode control.
 *   [17]       Auto Precharge. Only valid when using 10 row bits!
 *
 * IOSAV_n_SUBSEQ_CTRL_ch(channel, index)
 *   The parameters of the subseq: number of repetitions of the command,
 *   the delay between command executions, wait cycles after completing
 *   this subseq and before the next one, and the data direction of the
 *   command (read, write, neither, or both read and write).
 *
 *   Bitfields:
 *   [8..0]     Number of repetitions of the DRAM command in this subseq.
 *   [14..10]   Number of DCLK cycles to wait between two successive DRAM commands.
 *   [24..16]   Number of DCLK cycles to idle after this subseq and before the next subseq.
 *   [27..26]   The direction of the data:
 *                  00: None (non-data command)
 *                  01: Read
 *                  10: Write
 *                  11: Read & Write
 *
 * IOSAV_n_ADDRESS_LFSR_ch(channel, index)
 *   23-bit LFSR state. It is written into the LFSR when the subseq is
 *   loaded, and then read back from the LFSR when the subseq is done.
 *
 *   Bitfields:
 *   [22..0]    LFSR state.
 *
 * IOSAV_SEQ_CTL_ch(channel)
 *   IOSAV full sequence settings: number of subseqs, iterations, stop
 *   on error, maintenance cycles...
 *
 *   Bitfields:
 *   [7..0]     Number of full sequence executions. When this field becomes non-zero, then the
 *              sequence starts running immediately. This value is decremented after completing
 *              a full sequence iteration. When it is zero, the sequence is done. No decrement
 *              is done if this field is set to 0xff. This is the "infinite repeat" mode, and
 *              it is manually aborted by clearing this field.
 *
 *   [16..8]    Number of wait cycles after each sequence iteration. This wait's purpose is to
 *              allow performing maintenance in infinite loops. When non-zero, RCOMP, refresh
 *              and ZQXS operations can take place.
 *
 *   [17]       Stop-on-error mode: Whether to stop sequence execution when an error occurs.
 *   [19..18]   Number of subseqs. The programmed value is the index of the last valid subseq.
 *   [20]       If set, keep refresh disabled until the next sequence execution.
 *                  DANGER: Refresh must be re-enabled within the (9 * tREFI) period!
 *
 *   [22]       If set, sequence execution will not prevent refresh. This cannot be set when
 *              bit [20] is also set, or was set on the previous sequence. This bit exists so
 *              that the sequence machine can be used as a timer without affecting the memory.
 *
 *   [23]       If set, an output pin is asserted on the first detected error. This output can
 *              be used as a trigger for an oscilloscope or a logic analyzer, which is pretty
 *              useful for debugging (if you have the equipment and know where this pin is).
 *
 * IOSAV_DATA_CTL_ch(channel)
 *   Data-related controls in IOSAV mode.
 *
 *   Bitfields:
 *   [7..0]     WDB (Write Data Buffer) pattern length: [7..0] = (length / 8) - 1;
 *   [15..8]    WDB read pointer. Points at the data used for IOSAV write transactions.
 *   [23..16]   Comparison pointer. Used to compare data from IOSAV read transactions.
 *   [24]       If set, increment pointers only when micro-breakpoint is active.
 *
 * IOSAV_STATUS_ch(channel)
 *   Provides feedback on the state of the IOSAV sequence machine.
 *   Should be polled after submitting an IOSAV sequence for execution.
 *
 *   Bitfields:
 *   [0]        IDLE:  IOSAV is sleeping.
 *   [1]        BUSY:  IOSAV is running a sequence.
 *   [2]        DONE:  IOSAV has completed a sequence.
 *   [3]        ERROR: IOSAV detected an error and stopped on it, when using Stop-on-error.
 *   [4]        PANIC: The refresh machine issued a Panic Refresh, and IOSAV was aborted.
 *   [5]        RCOMP: RComp failure. Unused, consider Reserved.
 *   [6]        Cleared with a new sequence, and set when done and refresh counter is drained.

/*

 *
 * ECC_INJECT_COUNT_ch(channel)
 *  Defines the count of write chunks (64-bit data packets) until the

 *                  111: Inject non-recoverable ECC error on ECC error insertion counter.
 *
 *  [14]        ECC correction disable: when set, the MC reports every error as uncorrectable.

 *  [20]        DIMM B DDR chip width.
 *  [21]        Enable Rank Interleave.
 *  [22]        Enable Enhanced Rank Interleave.
