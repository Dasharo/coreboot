	  Sandy Bridge can either start verstage in a separate stage
	  right after the bootblock has run or it can start it
	  after romstage for compatibility reasons.
	  Sandy Bridge however uses a mrc.bin to initialize memory which
	  needs to be located at a fixed offset. Therefore even with
	  a separate verstage starting after the bootblock that same
	  binary is used meaning a jump is made from RW to the RO region
	  and back to the RW region after the binary is done.

	depends on USE_NATIVE_RAMINIT
	help
	  Ignore the CAPID fuses that might limit the maximum DRAM frequency
	  on overclocking-capable parts. By selecting this option, the fuse
	  values will be ignored and the only limits on DRAM frequency are
	  determined by SPD values, per-board devicetree settings and hard
	  limits in the northbridge's MPLL. Disabled by default as it can
	  cause instability.
	  Consider this to be an overclocking option. Handle with care!

config NATIVE_RAMINIT_IGNORE_XMP_MAX_DIMMS
	bool "[OVERCLOCK] Ignore XMP max DIMMs per channel"
	default n
	depends on USE_NATIVE_RAMINIT
	help
	  The more DIMMs are in a channel, the more signal integrity worsens.
	  Because of this, some DIMMs only support running at XMP timings if
	  the number of DIMMs in the channel is below a limit. This limit is
	  usually 1, i.e. there must be no other DIMMs in the channel to use
	  XMP timings. Otherwise, non-XMP timings are used.
	  When this option is enabled, the max DIMMs per channel restriction
	  in XMP is ignored. Depending on available margins, this could work
	  but it can also result in system instability.
	  Consider this to be an overclocking option. Handle with care!

config NATIVE_RAMINIT_IGNORE_XMP_REQUESTED_VOLTAGE
	bool "Ignore XMP profile requested voltage"
	default n
	depends on USE_NATIVE_RAMINIT
	help
	  Native raminit only supports 1.5V operation, but there are DIMMs
	  which request 1.65V operation in XMP profiles. This option allows
	  raminit to use these XMP profiles anyway, instead of falling back
	  to non-XMP settings.
	  Disabled by default because it allows forcing memory to run out of
	  specification. Consider this to be an overclocking option.
	  Handle with care!
