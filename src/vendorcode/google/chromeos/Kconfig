	help
	  Disable the platform heirarchy on resume path if the firmware
	  is involved in resume. The hierarchy is disabled prior to jumping
	  to the OS.  Note that this option is sepcific to TPM2 boards.
	  This option is auto selected if CHROMEOS because it matches with
	  vboot_reference model which disables the platform hierarchy in
	  the boot loader. However, those operations need to be symmetric
	  on normal boot as well as resume and coreboot is only involved
	  in the resume piece w.r.t. the platform hierarchy.

	  On some boards, there are calibrated parameters for Dynamic Speaker Management(DSM)

	help
	  On some boards that run old firmware version in cr50, Embedded Controller (EC) needs
	  to trigger the cold reset of Application Processor (AP) when CSE jumps from RO to RW
	  so that cr50 resets the TPM state. This is required on boards where the cr50 firmware
	  does not understand the new cr50 strap config (applicable only to boards using strap
	  config 0xe). Enabling this config will help to override the default global reset.

	  Some boards declare the DRAM part number in the CBI instead of the SPD.  This option
	  allows those boards to declare that their DRAM part number is stored in the CBI.
