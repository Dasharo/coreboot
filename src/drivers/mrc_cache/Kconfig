	  Instead of writing back MRC_CACHE training data back to the
	  MRC_CACHE right away, stash the data into cbmem.  This data
	  will be written back later to MRC_CACHE.  This is selected
	  for platforms which either do not support writes to SPI
	  flash in early stages
	  (BOOT_DEVICE_SPI_FLASH_NO_EARLY_WRITES) or the platforms
	  that need to write back the MRC data in late ramstage boot
	  states (MRC_WRITE_NV_LATE).
