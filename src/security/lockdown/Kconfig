	bool "Write-protect the whole boot medium"
	help
	  Select this if you want to write-protect the whole firmware boot
	  medium.

	  The locking will take place during the chipset lockdown.
	  Chipset lockdown is platform specific und might be done unconditionally,
	  when INTEL_CHIPSET_LOCKDOWN is set or has to be triggered later
	  (e.g. by the payload or the OS).

	  NOTE: If you trigger the chipset lockdown unconditionally,
	  you won't be able to write to the whole flash chip using the
	  internal controller any more.

	bool "Read- and write-protect the whole boot medium"
	help
	  Select this if you want to protect the firmware boot medium against
	  all further accesses. On platforms that memory map a part of the
	  boot medium the corresponding region is still readable.

	  The locking will take place during the chipset lockdown.

	help
	  Select this if you want to write-protect the WP_RO region as specified
	  in the VBOOT FMAP. You will be able to write every region outside
	  of WP_RO using the internal controller (eg. FW_MAIN_A/FW_MAIN_B).
	  In case of BOOTMEDIA_LOCK_IN_VERSTAGE the locking will take place
	  early, preventing locking of facilities used in ramstage, like the
	  MRC cache. If not using BOOTMEDIA_LOCK_IN_VERSTAGE the chipset lockdown
	  is either triggered by coreboot (when INTEL_CHIPSET_LOCKDOWN is set) or
	  has to be triggered later (e.g. by the payload or the OS).

	  Select this if you want to write-protect the WP_RO region as soon as
