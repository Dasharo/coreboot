 * Memory map for qemu vexpress-a9 since

 * 0x0000_0000: NOR flash

 * 0x6000_0000: RAM
 */

/*
 * This map is designed to work with new qemu vexpress memory layout and
 * with -bios option which neatly puts coreboot into flash and so payloads
 * can find CBFS and we don't risk overwriting CBFS.
 *
 * Prior to Jul 2014 qemu aliased 0 to begining of RAM instead of flash
 * and -bios was unusable as $pc pointed to 0 which was zero-filled as a
 * workaround we suggested using -kernel but this still had all the issues
 * of having fake-ROM in RAM. In fact it was even worse as fake ROM ends
 * up exactly at addresses needed to load Linux.
