	  This example mainboard code along with the example/min86 SoC
	  should serve as a minimal example how a buildable x86 SoC code
	  base can look like.

	  This can serve, for instance, as a basis to add new SoCs to
	  coreboot. Starting with a buildable commit should help with
	  the review of the actual code, and also avoid any regressions
	  when common coreboot code changes.
