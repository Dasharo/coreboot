	  Select this option to enable Above 4G Decode. This will allow the

	  Disabling memory above 4G is useful for bootloaders that are not

	  The path and filename of the file to use as graphical bootsplash
	  image. The file must be an uncompressed BMP, in BMP 3 format.

	  Linux can create these with the below command:
	      `convert splosh.bmp BMP3:splash.bmp`

	  This image will also be used as the BGRT boot image, which may
	  persist through your OS boot process.

	  See ACPI spec 6.3, 5.2.22 Boot Graphics Resource Table (BGRT), and
	  Microsoft's documentation on BGRT positioning:
	  Docs/Windows/Windows Drivers/Bring up guide/Boot screen components

	  Accordingly, the image used should be no taller/wider than 40% of
	  the display panel's native pixel height/width (or resolution set).

	  If an absolute path is not given, the path will assumed to be
	  relative to the coreboot root directory.

	  Select this option if you want to enable Tianocore logging to CBMEM.
	  You may want to increase the default cbmem buffer size when selecting
	  this option, especially if using a debug (vs release) build.
	  Selecting this option will increase the payload size in CBFS by 0x10000.
